  authorDescription: `"<em>I'd be a professional student if I could</em>..." <br /><br />
  "<em>I'm a lot more function over form... I couldn't design my way out of a paper bag...</em>..." <br /><br />
  I have been building websites since 2011. I love web development because it is the perfect mix of problem solving, building, and lifelong learning.<br/><br />
  Currently VP of Development at The Digital Ring, I split my time between developing websites and developing developers. Prior to joining TDR, I freelanced as a sole proprietor (Finch Professional Services), worked with dozens of clients through platforms like Toptal and Codeable, and completed a brief stint as a web engineer with 10up.<br/><br />
  I collect masters degrees (three so far), have traveled to six continents, lived on four, speak Spanish, and outside of work, family, friends, food, coffee, and cooking are my favorite activities. I live in Wisconsin with my wonderful wife and two daughters.<br /><br />
